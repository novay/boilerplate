# Laravel Boilerplate

ðŸ’¡ This is a fork of the [Laravel Breeze for Laravel Splade](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-splade-breeze) implementation. And build for my personal use.

## Documentation

ðŸ“– The installation process is quite simple.

```bash
laravel new example-app

cd example-app

composer require novay/boilerplate

php artisan breeze:install


```

Do not forget to migrate our default migration:

```bash
php artisan migrate
````

The `breeze:install` command will also build the frontend assets. Just like [regular Laravel applications](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/vite#running-vite), you may run the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
````
